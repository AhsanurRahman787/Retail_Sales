# Retail Sales Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project analyzes multi-year (2014--2018) retail sales data to
identify revenue trends, regional performance, customer behavior, and
profitability. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making by
uncovering growth opportunities and optimizing sales strategies through
structured analysis and visualization.

## Problem Statement

Sales teams often lack clear insights into regional performance, product
profitability, and customer value, leading to inefficient utilization of
opportunity costs. This project addresses this challenge by transforming
raw sales data into actionable insights using exploratory data analysis
(EDA) and visual analytics.

## Tech Stack

-   **Programming Language:** Python
-   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Aggregation, Visualization,
    Correlation Analysis

## Key Features

-   Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw retail sales datasets
-   Creation and integration of multiple related dataframes
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
-   Visualization of top revenue-generating products
-   Sales performance analysis by channel
-   Average Order Value (AOV) distribution analysis
-   Unit price distribution per product
-   Top 10 states by revenue and order count
-   Average profit margin analysis by sales channel
-   Top and bottom 10 customers by revenue
-   Customer segmentation based on revenue vs profit margin
-   Correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between sales metrics

## Insights Generated

-   Identified high-performing products, regions, and sales channels
-   Highlighted customer segments contributing most to revenue and
    profit
-   Revealed correlations between pricing, sales volume, cost, and
    profitability
-   Supported data-driven evaluation of regional growth opportunities
